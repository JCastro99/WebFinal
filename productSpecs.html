        <h3><b>How it began</b></h3>
        <p>
          This project is the first time using unity for the four of us putting it together. <br/>
          We have been working on it for about two weeks at this point in time, and the main <br/>
          reason for starting it was school. We started it as our final project in our Object <br/>
          Oriented Programming class. We were just throwing out ideas on what we could do, <br/>
          whe Ashley threw out the idea of a dating simulator. At first it was kinda laughed <br/>
          off until we started thinking about it a bit more. We realized that being in a school<br/>
          filled with programmers, we could make it based on the personificatinos of some of<br/>
          the popular programming languages. Coming up with how the characters could act, and <br/>
          knowing that several people have already given many of the languages their own human <br/>
          personality. Then one thing after another, here we are today!
