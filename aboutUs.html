              <h3><b>How it began</b></h3>
              <p>
                This project is the first time using unity for the four of us putting it together. <br/>
                We have been working on it for about two weeks at this point in time, and the main <br/>
                reason for starting it was school. We started it as our final project in our Object <br/>
                Oriented Programming class. We were just throwing out ideas on what we could do, <br/>
                whe Ashley threw out the idea of a dating simulator. At first it was kinda laughed <br/>
                off until we started thinking about it a bit more. We realized that being in a school<br/>
                filled with programmers, we could make it based on the personificatinos of some of<br/>
                the popular programming languages. Coming up with how the characters could act, and <br/>
                knowing that several people have already given many of the languages their own human <br/>
                personality. Then one thing after another, here we are today!

              <h3>Our Future Plans</h3>
              <p>
                Our plans for this project obviously include the things on our checklist that we have <br/>
                not yet completed. However, it also includes several other things like potentially <br/>
                selling the game to attemp to gain some money. This has not been decided for sure by <br/>
                any means. If it does go through though, it would be nice to be able to get the game <br/>
                released on the steam store allowing for easier access to the game.

              <h3>Current Status</h3>
              <p>
                The game is currently entering a slower patch of development due to the fact that we <br/>
                no longer need to be working on it for a grade. However it will very much still be in <br/>
                development until it is in a complete state that we are all happy with. We are already <br/>
                proud of ourselves for how far we have gotten, but we know we can, and will, do better.
